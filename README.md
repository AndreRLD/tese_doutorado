# tese_doutorado
Data from my doctoral thesis. The spreadsheet titled 'dados_doutorado_20-06-2023.csv' contains all the data from my doctoral thesis. All statistical analyses were conducted using this spreadsheet in the R software, including the statistical analyses of the data presented in the manuscript submitted to the journal Biomedicines. The spreadsheet 'article_data.csv' is a subset of 'dados_doutorado_20-06-2023.csv' and contains only the data included in the article submitted to Biomedicines.

To run code written by another programmer in RStudio, first save the data file (e.g., dados_doutorado_20-06-2023.csv) in a known folder on your computer. Then, open RStudio and set the working directory to that folder using the menu (Session > Set Working Directory > Choose Directory...) or by typing setwd("C:/your/path"), replacing with the actual path to your file. Before running the code, make sure you have installed all the R packages used in the analysis. You can do this by running commands like install.packages("ggplot2") for each required package. These are usually listed at the beginning of the code after the word library(). Once the working directory is set and all packages are installed, you can run the code in RStudio.
